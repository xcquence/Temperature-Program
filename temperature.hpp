The following program is a result of personal effort. I have not discussed with
anyone other than my instructor or any appropriate person in charge of the
class.
I have not used code or portion of code from another student, or any other

If any C++ language code or documentation used in my program was obtained
from another source, such as a text book or course notes, that has been clearly
noted with a proper citation in the comments of my program.
I have not designed this program in such a way as to defeat or interfere with
the normal operation of the eniac system or cslab machines at Hunter College .
